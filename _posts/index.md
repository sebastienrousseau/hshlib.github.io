## Overview

The Hash (HSH) Rust library provides an interface for implementing
secure hash and digest algorithms, specifically designed for password
encryption and verification.

The library provides a simple API that makes it easy to store and verify
hashed passwords. It enables robust security for passwords, using the
latest advancements in Quantum-resistant cryptography. Quantum-
resistant cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms, usually
public-key algorithms, that are thought to be secure against an attack
by a quantum computer. As quantum computing continues to advance, this
feature of the library assures that the passwords managed through this
system remain secure even against cutting-edge computational
capabilities.

The library supports the following Password Hashing Schemes (Password
Based Key Derivation Functions):

- [**Argon2i**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2>): A cutting-edge
  and highly secure key derivation function designed to protect against
  both traditional brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks.
  (Recommended)
- [**Bcrypt**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt>): A password
  hashing function designed to be secure against brute-force attacks.
  It is a work-factor function, which means that it takes a certain
  amount of time to compute. This makes it difficult to attack with a
  brute-force algorithm.
- [**Scrypt**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt>): A password
  hashing function designed to be secure against both brute-force
  attacks and rainbow table attacks. It is a memory-hard and work-
  factor function, which means that it requires a lot of memory and
  time to compute. This makes it very difficult to attack with a GPU
  or other parallel computing device.

The library is a valuable tool for developers who need to store and
verify passwords in a secure manner. It is easy to use and can be
integrated into a variety of applications.
