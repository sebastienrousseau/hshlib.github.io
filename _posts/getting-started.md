## Requirements

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust
**1.69.0** or later (stable). It is recommended that you install the
latest stable version of Rust.

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install Hash (HSH) using the following command:

```shell
cargo install ssg
```

## Platform support

`Hash (HSH)` is supported and tested on the following platforms:

### Tier 1 platforms

Rust Tier 1 targets are officially supported and guaranteed to work.

| | Operating System | Target | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| âœ… | Linux   | aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu | 64-bit Linux systems on ARM architecture |
| âœ… | Linux   | i686-unknown-linux-gnu | 32-bit Linux (kernel 3.2+, glibc 2.17+) |
| âœ… | Linux   | x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu | 64-bit Linux (kernel 2.6.32+, glibc 2.11+) |
| âœ… | macOS   | x86_64-apple-darwin | 64-bit macOS (10.7 Lion or later) |
| âœ… | Windows | i686-pc-windows-gnu | 32-bit Windows (7 or later) |
| âœ… | Windows | i686-pc-windows-msvc | 32-bit Windows (7 or later) |
| âœ… | Windows | x86_64-pc-windows-gnu | 64-bit Windows (7 or later) |
| âœ… | Windows | x86_64-pc-windows-msvc | 64-bit Windows (7 or later) |

### Tier 2 platforms

Rust Tier 2 targets are supported for building, but not necessarily running.

| | Operating System | Target | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| âœ… | Linux   | aarch64-unknown-linux-musl | 64-bit Linux systems on ARM architecture |
| âœ… | Linux   | arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi | ARMv6 Linux (kernel 3.2, glibc 2.17) |
| âœ… | Linux   | arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf | ARMv7 Linux, hardfloat (kernel 3.2, glibc 2.17) |
| âœ… | Linux   | armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf | ARMv7 Linux, hardfloat (kernel 3.2, glibc 2.17) |
| âœ… | macOS   | aarch64-apple-darwin | 64-bit macOS (10.7 Lion or later) |
| âœ… | Windows | aarch64-pc-windows-msvc | 64-bit Windows (7 or later) |

## Documentation

You can find the documentation on [docs.rs][02], [lib.rs][03] and [crates.io][01].

## Usage ðŸ“–

To use `hsh` in your project, add the following to your `cargo.toml`
file:

```toml
[dependencies]
hsh = "0.0.7"
```

Add the following to your `main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate hsh;
use hsh::*;
```

then you can use the functions in your application code.

### Examples

`Hash (HSH)` comes with a set of examples that you can use to get
started. The examples are located in the `examples` directory of the
project. To run the examples, clone the repository and run the following
command in your terminal from the project root directory.

```shell
cargo run --example hsh
```
